# Session

`Session` manages when a list of child elements are displayed. Each child receives an item prop that contains methods and properties related to navigating and transforming the list. Only the first child is rendered. It's up to the child elements to call `props.item.next` to show the next child.

## Usage
<Playground>
  <Session>
    <div>shown</div>
    <div>not shown</div>
  </Session>
</Playground>

## Props
<Props of={Session} />
